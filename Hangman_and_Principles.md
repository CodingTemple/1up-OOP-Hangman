Below is a detailed document that outlines how the five key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles discussed earlier—Encapsulation, Abstraction, Separation of Concerns, Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), and Modularity—will be applied to the design and development of the Hangman game. This document serves as a guide for implementing best practices in OOP to ensure a robust, maintainable, and scalable application.

## Applying OOP Principles to the Hangman Game

### Introduction
The Hangman game is a simple word guessing game where a player tries to figure out a hidden word by guessing letters. To develop this game using OOP methodologies, we will structure our application around two main classes: `Game` and `UserInterface`. Each of these classes will embody the core OOP principles to ensure clear, maintainable, and efficient code.

### 1. Encapsulation

**Implementation:**
- **`Game` Class:** This class will encapsulate all the properties related to the game state such as the word to be guessed, the set of guessed letters, and the count of incorrect guesses. Methods that modify these properties, such as `guess_letter` and `is_solved`, will also be encapsulated within this class to keep the game's internal state secure and coherent.
- **`UserInterface` Class:** This class will manage all user interactions, encapsulating the logic for displaying game information, collecting user inputs, and showing game results. By keeping these functionalities within a single class, we protect and isolate the user interaction processes from the core game logic.

### 2. Abstraction

**Implementation:**
- **Abstraction of Game Mechanics:** The `Game` class provides a simple interface for game operations like making a guess or checking game status, hiding the complex logic of how guesses are evaluated or how the game state is updated.
- **User Interaction Abstraction:** The `UserInterface` class offers methods like `display_game_state` and `get_user_input` that abstract the details of command-line input/output, allowing the rest of the application to interact with the user without knowing the details of user communication.

### 3. Separation of Concerns

**Implementation:**
- **Distinct Game Logic and UI Management:** By separating the game logic (`Game` class) from the user interaction logic (`UserInterface` class), the application cleanly divides responsibilities. Each class focuses on a distinct aspect of the application—game state management and user interaction, respectively—enhancing maintainability and scalability.

### 4. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

**Implementation:**
- **`Game` Class Responsibilities:** The `Game` class is solely responsible for managing the gameplay. It controls the game rules, tracks player moves, and determines win/lose conditions.
- **`UserInterface` Class Responsibilities:** The `UserInterface` class is dedicated to handling all interactions with the user. It displays the game state, collects user inputs, and shows messages, ensuring that these user-related processes are centralized and independent of game logic.

### 5. Modularity

**Implementation:**
- **Modular Components:** Both the `Game` and `UserInterface` classes are designed as modular components that can be independently developed, tested, and modified. This modularity allows for easy updates and maintenance of each class without affecting the other.
- **Reusability and Scalability:** The modular design facilitates potential extensions like adding different modes of play (e.g., timed mode, multiplayer) or upgrading the user interface from a console to a graphical interface without major overhauls of the game logic.

### Conclusion
By applying these OOP principles, the Hangman game will be well-structured, easy to manage, and ready for future expansion. Each principle helps in crafting a software solution that is not only functional but also robust and adaptable to changing requirements or new technologies.
