## Lecture Overview: Understanding OOP Design with a Hangman Game

### Introduction

This lecture aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles through a practical demonstration by developing a Hangman game. By applying theoretical concepts to a concrete project, participants will gain a deeper appreciation and understanding of how OOP principles can be utilized to create robust, maintainable, and scalable software.

### Objectives

1. **Understand Core OOP Principles**: Introduce and explain the five key OOP principlesâ€”Encapsulation, Abstraction, Separation of Concerns, Single Responsibility Principle, and Modularity.
2. **See OOP in Action**: Apply these principles in real-time by developing a Hangman game, demonstrating how each principle influences the design and implementation of the software.
3. **Develop Problem-Solving Skills**: Enhance participants' ability to think in terms of objects, with a focus on how to break down a problem into manageable parts using OOP.
4. **Encourage Best Practices**: Instill best practices in software development by emphasizing the importance of clean, organized, and testable code.

### Lecture Structure

**Part 1: Introduction to OOP**
- Brief discussion on the evolution of programming paradigms leading to OOP.
- Definitions and detailed explanations of the five key OOP principles.

**Part 2: Setup and Project Overview**
- Overview of the tools and environment setup for developing the Hangman game.
- Introduction to the project structure and the roles of different classes (`Game` and `UserInterface`).

**Part 3: Deep Dive into OOP with Hangman Game**
- Step-by-step development of the Hangman game:
  - **`Game` Class Development**: Focus on Encapsulation and SRP by implementing game logic.
  - **`UserInterface` Class Development**: Illustrate Abstraction and Separation of Concerns with user interaction handling.
- Discussion on how Modularity facilitates future enhancements and testing.


### Expected Outcomes

At the end of this lecture, participants should be able to:
- Articulate the key principles of OOP and their benefits in software development.
- Apply OOP concepts to any software development project effectively.
- Think critically about software design and how to structure code in an object-oriented manner.
- Feel confident in exploring more complex OOP projects and continuing their learning journey in advanced programming concepts.

### Conclusion

This lecture is designed not only to teach the theoretical aspects of Object-Oriented Programming but also to demonstrate these principles in action through a tangible project. Participants will leave with both the knowledge and practical experience needed to implement OOP concepts in their future projects.
